<p>“This server’s dead as fuck.”</p>
<p>Meii, confused, scoffed as he scrolled through Acap, which was
indeed.. Dead. Deader than Sean’s grandma. Nobody talked, not even the
irrelevant members trying to be relevant.</p>
<p>“Rain hasn’t responded to my insta posts yet!”</p>
<p>Meii blurted out loud with a hurt expression, grabbing his chest as
if he was having a heart attack. This was strange to him, Rain wasn’t
the type of person to just disappear… something was off- very off.</p>
<p>Days ago, Forty invited the Owomachads to a reunion to discuss
something important. But since it wasn’t for a circlejerk, Meii didn’t
assist. Which he then regretted, since he felt like it’d answer</p>
<p>some questions.<img src="./nqljb31f.png"
style="width:3.91168in;height:4.74513in" /></p>
<p>He messaged an owomachad- but to no avail.</p>
<p>In a hellcat, the 6’5 model, Meii, drove to ACAP HQ. He arrived
safely, as he wasn’t a woman.</p>
<p>The door was locked, denying Meii’s entry. So like any normal human
being would, he slapped his dick on the glass door, shattering it.</p>
<p>Meii looked around and saw that it was empty.</p>
<p>First floor, which was where people would check in. There was always
a secretary at the front desk. Either Leith, Denii or Angelo. Most
people liked it when Angelo was the secretary because he’d wear thigh
highs and was easily bribed with a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>But this time, there wasn’t a choice to pick favorites.</p>
<p>On floor 9 + 10 (21), where Joseph’s meeting was held, Meii looked.
The whiteboard still had plenty of info from the meeting, which was
perfectly convenient for him.</p>
<p>Taking all this into account, the thing that stood out the most to
Meii, was a blueprint of the Headquarters. It revealed that underneath
the secretary’s desk, there was a trapdoor.</p>
<p>Since Meii was already prepared, he returned to the first floor to
see for himself.</p>
<p>*◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>The door handle was rusty, discomforting Meii. So instead of turning
the knob, he slapped the door with his dick.</p>
<p>Like every other instance, the door shattered. What an aMeiizing cock
:]</p>
<p>He knelt down and tried to unlock it, but none of the keys worked. So
he slid his finger in the keyhole and fingered it, which actually
worked.<img src="./1zxq3tu1.png"

<p>“Classic Forty.”</p>
<p>Down were stairs that led to a hallway with a singular door. Meii
noticed that a warm light (specifically #f7d8ae) was shining from behind
the door, and he sighed in relief.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the door was already unlocked so he slowly opened it,
finding a muscular; tall figure sleeping on a queen bed right next to
the door.</p>
<p>Rya?.. Mei thought, sneakishly making his way to the door at the
other end. Right before he could even touch the door handle, he felt the
footsteps of the figure. They were silent, Meii barely feeling them.</p>

<p>Meii felt a tap on his shoulder and looked up behind him to see Rya,
staring right at his soul.</p>
<p>“AAAAAAAHH”, Meii screeched.</p>
<p>Forty was lying next to Rya. Once he felt vacant where Rya was
supposed to be, he awoke. Gripping the sheets with his nails and
watching Rya hold someone, he recognized Mei, one of his former
colleagues.</p>
<p>“MEII?!</p>
<p>IT SHOULD’VE BEEN ME!!!!!“</p>
<p>He launched himself and knocked Meii out of Rya’s reach. Which, Forty
quickly realized was a mistake as he saw Meii reach out for something in
his purse.</p>
<p>“Wait no, yeah- RYA, RESTRAIN MEII!!”</p>
<p>Rya quickly obliged and held Meii once again in place, although this
time using rope.</p>
<p>“Rya…?”</p>
<p>Meii questioned with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>“Meii.. Holy shit! Long time no see. Tell me though, why are you
here?” Forty interrogated as he looked down at him with a raised
eyebrow.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>To which, Meii didn’t reply, as he didn’t feel like it’d do any good
for him.</p>
<p>“Quiet, aren’t we..”</p>
<p>Said Forty, walking in circles. Until, he suddenly stood still.
“Well, I’m afraid you leave me no choice.”</p>
<p>Forty then walked to his desk, opening a drawer full to the brim of
dildos. He chuckled under his breath, stroking his microscopic chin
hairs. Hovering his hand over the collection, he picked the roughest,
most barbed one.</p>
<p>He spat on it as lubrication and walked back to Mei.</p>
<p>“Wait what-“ Meii uttered.</p>
<p>“Talk.” Forty said, taking a step closer.</p>
<p>Meii flinched, responding almost immediately. “Okay! I’ll talk!”</p>
<p>Forty snickered, handing the dildo to Rya so she could dig in.</p>
<p>“So good!!! Nyaah~!!” Rya cried out, overjoyed by her weekly meal as
Joseph and Meii watched from behind.</p>
<p><img src="./caet4fs3.png"
style="width:6.66763in;height:8.6568in" /></p>
<p>“Leith..”</p>
<p>Meii blurted with a sigh, which made the two wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“Leith what?”</p>
<p>Forty asked, almost excited.</p>
<p>“He gave me the address..” Mei admitted, his eyes closed.</p>
<p>Forty, thinking of what to do now, turned back to Rya, gesturing for
her to lean down to his level.</p>
<p>“Fix her up and get her in.”, Forty whispered.</p>
<p>“Inside u?” Rya responded, crumbs of plastic cock flying out her
mouth.</p>
<p>“No- in the game!”</p>
<p>*◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>7:36 am</p>
<p>I don’t remember how my morning went, everything that comes to mind
is pushed out instantly. I hadn’t eaten yesterday and have already
gotten used to eating 3 meals a day, so I’m starving and about to cry
myself back to sleep.</p>
<p>There’s 8 people here in the dining hall with me, whom I haven’t
distinguished because I’m looking down. I guess I can tell by their
voice and body, if they have a flat ass it’s either Hex or Ink. Well,
Hex since Ink is dead now.</p>
<p>“Does anyone know who cleaned the mess?” Gerald asked.</p>
<p>“Forty.”</p>
<p>Saur simply answered.</p>
<p>“How are we supposed to know?!” Kyle asked back with a :/ face.</p>
<p>“They probably did it while we were asleep. Kek.” Zam theorized.</p>
<p>Geuco</p>
<p>“…. what if somebody stays up to find out?”</p>
<p>I offered, but clearly noone gave a shit about what I had to say so
it was quiet.</p>
<p>I was tired of all these fakies, so I walked to a bench and sat on
it. Almost, since Redsilver creeped up and sat on it before me.</p>
<p>“Too slow.”, I heard her mutter.</p>
<p>“That was nasty. As. FUCK.” Kat commented, which made me look up,
since her voice woke me up.</p>
<p>“I had a feeling somebody was going to kill.”</p>
<p>Hex whined, as he tried not to cry because he stubbed his toe in the
morning.</p>
<p>“Wait what- Why?”</p>
<p>Rain asked with almost an offended expression.</p>
<p>“You’re all crazy.” Hex replied with a frustrated expression. I
thought he was going to leave, but it seems he’s waiting for food
too.</p>
<p>“I miss my Sheri.“ Sal sighed as she looked into oblivion with her
jaw against her hand on the table.</p>
<p><img src="./qagv2mvm.png"
style="width:5.03406in;height:6.72319in" /></p>
<p>The cafeteria was full, and food still wasn’t being served.</p>
<p>“What’s taking them so long?!” Shaqi impatiently questioned.</p>
<p>“ATTENTION GOYS.”</p>
<p>We all suddenly heard, which was coming from the lobby. Exchanging
looks, we contemplated on going.</p>
<p>“Big bro Joseph!!”</p>
<p>Abood happily affirmed as he wobbled to the lobby.</p>
<p>We didn’t hear any gunshots so we all then followed.</p>
<p>“Finally.”, Forty exclaimed as he saw all of us. “Okay so, I’m
extending your starvation until 9am.”</p>
<p>“Oh wow.“</p>
<p>Sal annoyed, huffed.</p>
<p>“Sadist.”</p>
<p>Zam hypocritically huffed.</p>
<p>“Do you like seeing us hungry??” Redsilver questioned with a bothered
look.</p>
<p>“That. AND you’re kind of getting fat..”</p>
<p>Forty responded with a chuckle as he then turned around to his cave.
“Alright, that’s all. Toodles!”</p>
<p>“Mfw mod abuse.”</p>
<p>Yoshi uttered with an eye roll, leaving.</p>
<p><img src="./zdujevia.png"
style="width:6.62318in;height:3.76721in" />“WHY DOESN’T ANYONE FLUSH THE
TOILET??!!” Kat randomly berated.</p>
<p>“Genius. They were prepared in advance.”<img src="./ltblnzce.png"
style="width:4.73402in;height:5.07851in" /></p>
<p>Kyle commented with an idiotic smile as he slobbered and had lots of
saliva streaming down his mouth.</p>
<p>It seemed me and the other relatively normal people here would rather
starve for the time being, so I went back to my room and thought about
Toya’s nudes.</p>
<p>*◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>Wanting to prevent someone else from interfering, Forty left the
edifice to abduct the retards he should’ve but
didn’t.<img src="./31kt5ckg.png"
style="width:6.93433in;height:4.83403in" /></p>
<p>First up was Sean, who was roleplaying as a dog. Then Alfie, who was
watching Sean roleplay as a dog. Oreca, who was bleaching his skin.</p>
<p>Big, who was vaping a cartnite.</p>
<p>Racer, who was feeding pigeons with bread. Luna, who was probably
doing nerd shit idfk And lastly, Leith, who was still drooling for
Mer.</p>
<p>Once Forty rounded them all up in his room + Meii already in there,
it was about to be 9:00 am exactly.</p>
<p>Assuming Rya already had the food ready to serve, Forty was gonna
switch up the game.</p>
<p>*◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>8:58 pm</p>
<p>I was already outside my dorm, walking down the hallway when I heard
Forty seductively call us.</p>
<p>“BOIS!!!”</p>
<p>Once we all appeared, the first thing we saw was the 8 new “people”
in front of us.</p>
<p>Like a deadbeat dad, Forty pushed them out of his room and went back
in, leaving his 8 new fetuses in The Virgin Games.</p>
<p>“I don’t even know half of these niggers.”<img src="./j4ruli0x.png"
style="width:1.98918in;height:2.3559in" /><img src="./tdu0vxri.png"
style="width:1.91139in;height:1.93361in" /><img src="./jspnp1wq.png"
style="width:1.91139in;height:1.65579in" /></p>
<p>Yoshi asserted with a squint as she stared them down.</p>
<p>“N*wgens.”</p>
<p>Hex rudely said as he walked to the dining hall.</p>
<p>“Woof.”</p>
<p>Niketos protested.</p>
<p>“What newgen mean” Racer asked.</p>
<p>“Bruh. I’m not a newgen.” Big proclaimed.</p>
<p>“Omg.. Branden??”</p>
<p>Shaqi expressed with an unsure yet content voice.</p>
<p>“Yo.”</p>
<p>Big simply responded.</p>
<p><img src="./oo55pfc3.png"
style="width:0.20003in;height:0.20003in" />“I hate not being relevant
enough ” Oreca farted.<img src="./zkinelek.png"
style="width:3.30048in;height:1.74469in" /><img src="./i5vytq3j.png"
style="width:1.55578in;height:1.42243in" /></p>
<p>“Big bro Leith!!!” Abood called out.</p>
<p>“Lil bro Ahmed!!” Leith responded.</p>
<p>This was so cringe, it felt like a reunion with relatives you haven’t
seen in years.</p>
<p>“We are modeling the energy necessary for an electron to change the
energy band.” Luna added.</p>
<p><img src="./01g4tq3n.png"
style="width:1.78915in;height:3.74499in" /><img src="./0ains0uv.png"
style="width:1.24462in;height:4.06725in" /></p>
<p>“Uh. Where’s the bathroom? Seanie needs to tinkle.” The alien fucker
asked.</p>
<p>“Upstairs, middle room.”</p>
<p>Gerald replied, pointing at the stairs with a nod.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>Kerroid thanked as he held Sean’s hand and went upstairs.</p>
<p>“Woof”</p>
<p>Sean parted.</p>
<p>I got goosebumps.</p>
<p>“Omg. RAIN!!”</p>
<p>Meii shouted as he ran up to her and hugged her.</p>
<p>“HII!”</p>
<p>Rain responded as she hugged him back.</p>
<p>To which, Zam and Saur weren’t too comfortable as they just blankly
stared.</p>
<p><img src="./a5f2uk1i.png"
style="width:5.46746in;height:7.2566in" /></p>
<p>There was nobody I cared that much for who arrived, except for Sean,
so I went to the dining hall to eat.</p>
<p>I still heard voices from the lobby, since it was pretty quiet in the
dining hall. Hex, Yoshi, Zam, Saur, Sal, Kyle and I were eating in
silence.</p>
<p>“Who do you think is gonna die this time..”</p>
<p>Redsilver asked at the entrance of the room, asking anybody.</p>
<p>“Hopefully you.”</p>
<p>Hex swiftly responded as he finished eating and walked out.</p>
<p>“LOL. Same.” Kyle added.</p>
<p>“A BIT of an insensitive question..”</p>
<p>Sal criticized with a miffed face, clearly she was still upset with
Sheri’s death because she’s wh*te.</p>
<p>“Does anybody even know who those guys are..” Yoshi questioned as she
started to feel xenophobic.</p>
<p>“Angelo’s girlfriend is Oreca, La Rata is Sean, the alien fucker is
Alfie, big is branden, one of those twinks is Meii and slenderman is
Leith.”</p>
<p>Kyle mansplained.</p>
<p>“What??” Zam said.</p>
<p>“Youre no caughtu p wit the acap lore. NEwgenr.” Saur claimed.</p>
<p>“Oooh, Meii stole rain from you…”</p>
<p>Redsilver taunted as she looked at Saur and Zam, which didn’t seem to
have much of a reaction.</p>
<p>“Isn’t Meii gay…” Sal asked.</p>
<p>“Sean is so cute.”</p>
<p>I whispered while salivating.</p>
<p>“Eating fast to avoid the niggers(real)”</p>
<p>Yoshi commented as she then quickly finished and walked out.</p>
<p>“…You cant say that.”</p>
<p>Sal scolded loud enough so she could hear.</p>
<p>“Wait!! I didn’t even get to eat!”</p>
<p>Redsilver whined as she grabbed a plate with food and went after
her.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t Forty kidnap Kristi or Hamnah..”</p>
<p>Kyle said with a sad tone of voice as he almost cried, so I
discreetly twisted his nipple in hopes of seeing at least one tear. He
didn’t. Tough toes.</p>
<p>Right as 11 fetuses all noisily barged into the dining hall; Saur and
Zam left.</p>
<p>“BRO FIST!!!” I heard celebrations and synchronized laughs as Sean’s
anus was fisted.</p>
<p>I stomped on the group, jealous. Why won’t they fist me? I literally
crossdress for them on roblox.</p>
<p>“There’s only one bathroom…” Kerroid brought up, just disappointed
that he and Sean would have to hurry their masturbation sessions.</p>
<p>“Vaperoom- boink who threw me a carrot?!??” Big questioned as he
turned around and saw nobody suspicious except for the blackies (It
wasn’t a carrot, but Big’s buttplug that Saur ripped out of his ass
while he wasn’t looking)</p>
<p>“Brah. LOL.” Leith loled. Somebody get this man outta my house.</p>
<p>“How it feels like to be in the acap dining hall.”, Sean said.</p>
<p>“Watch everybody copy him.” Racer predicted.</p>
<p>“As a trans woman, why is nobody scared of being in here??” Luna
asked with an upset expression.</p>
<p>“We’re not trans.” I say, as I wish I was white, for I’d punch the
wall out of frustration because I’m dumber than Branden. (What does that
mean nat)</p>
<p>“Yeah, Heil the-man-who-would’ve-killed-me-on-sight!” Abood
enunciated as he saluted to the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Aw. Where did Rain and Meii go?” Shaqi asked as she lazily looked
around, noticing the excessive male energy- which I enjoyed.</p>
<p>I secretly wish Ps3 or Donnie was here, but this works.</p>
<p>“Too much men :( I don’t like men.” Kat whined.</p>
<p>“You probably shouldn’t say that, Kat.” Gerald warned.</p>
<p>“YOU should probably use better phrasing…” Sal suggested.</p>
<p>“Run Kat!! He’s threatening to rape and kill you (in a bad way).”
Kyle looked shocked, but I don’t think he was shocked, rather
excited.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry guys you know I won’t let this happen.” Racer
claimed.</p>
<p>“Going for Joseph’s ex is crazy.” Leith added.</p>
<p>“Big bro Joseph!!” Abood cheered, which made Forty consider using the
lasers implemented in the cameras to kill him.</p>
<p>“Me when women here are treated bad.” Oreca said as he pulled an
image of a man in distress.</p>
<p>“I sure do love radicalized kids!” Luna uttered.</p>
<p>“Of course you do.” I said. I was then thrown a tomato. Thank the
heavens! I’ve never touched a clean tomato IML.</p>
<p>◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>Rain’s room.</p>
<p>“So.. uh.. why’d you wanna come to my room?” Rain asked as she looked
at Meii, who was looking through his purse.</p>
<p>“Well, to escape, duh. Don’t you want to get out of here?” Meii said
with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>“What about the rest??”</p>
<p>“Oh. Them. We can always come back for them, later.”</p>
<p>“WHAT! Nuh uh. I want to save Zam and Saur.”</p>
<p>“LATER!! It’s too dangerous if we go out all together.” Rain then
looked down and sighed, thunderstuck on the idea (get it cuz she’s rain
and thunderstruck and she’s stuck on the idea thudnerstuck like
thunderstruck get it)</p>
<p>“How are we getting out..”</p>
<p>“Time machine! Was that not obvious?” As Meii pulls a time machine
out of her purse.</p>
<p>“HOW WOULD THATBE OBVIOUS?!!!” Rain said as she stepped back.</p>
<p>“I got it from Temu for 99 cents, get in” Meii urges, as he already
was in.</p>
<p>“I’m so confused rn. Why don’t we escape normally, why do you have a
TIME machine, HOW do you have a time machine, why is it on TEMU, when
did the-“</p>
<p>“RAIN, do you not want to escape.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but..”</p>
<p>“Girl, just get in!” So Rain, feeling threatened, stepped in.</p>
<p>“How far back in time are we going?”</p>
<p>“Probably to when Forty was going to create ACAP.”</p>
<p>“But.. that means I wouldn’t know you, or anybody else here!” “I love
you Rain, but do you really want to be trapped here to kill
eachother?!??”</p>
<p>“Well noooo, but…”</p>
<p>“That’s that!” Meii then clicked a bunch of buttons and both then
felt weirdly vibrational, like as if they were using a rose toy.
WeeGRHyeaaaGLOPPPbeeepeeieeeieeiieeeii EEEEEEEEEEEE</p>
<p><img src="./oxry0xj1.png"
style="width:5.36744in;height:3.02266in" /></p>
<p>“MY EAAARRRRSS!!!” Rain cried out as she heard the noises, covering
her ears because she’s neaurodievirgin.
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEyankBOiooopppLEEHHH</p>
<p>“I knew it was too good-“ Meii was then interrupted by 5 loud crash
sound effect, and then the feeling that they got hit.</p>
<p>“WHAT THE GUICKKCK!!!!” Rain screamed as she then fell over.</p>
<p>“GIRL. You should probably eat more.” Meii suggested as he helped her
get up.</p>
<p>“Me??”</p>
<p>“Ugh. I don’t think this stupid shit worked.” Meii grumpily said as
he then walked out, and immediately stood still as if he just got
tazed.</p>
<p><img src="./kyswqztz.png"
style="width:5.38967in;height:3.44494in" />“Well? Are we still stuck
here??” Rain asked, hesitating to completely get out, but did anyway to
see why Meii got quiet. Rain looked around and was almost blinded by the
lights. The color palette of this place was that of a lesbian flag, of
course Rain could identify that. There was also a sign that said
“werk”.</p>
<p><img src="./z2fz2lhd.png"
style="width:5.38967in;height:3.44494in" /></p>
<p>“Where are we..???” She asked as she looked up at Meii.</p>
<p>“Wait what.. OMG. We’re in… omgomgomgomgomgomg RUPAUL’S DRAG RACE!!”
Meii revealed said as he covered his mouth, surprised.</p>
<p>“RUPAUL’S DRAG RACE?!??? WHYYY??!!!” “I DON’T KNOW- but I do know I’m
gonna look better than everybody else.”</p>
<p>“Let’s get out of here…”</p>
<p>“NO. Let’s dress up pleasepleasepleaseplease-“</p>
<p>“WHAT! WHY?!???”</p>
<p>“Umm.. Rain, it’s Rupaul’s drag race..”</p>
<p>“Uh.. no way. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Rain. IN A MINUTE!!” Meii then went to look for clothing and make
up, trying them out.</p>
<p>“MEII!!!!!!”</p>
<p>“Oooh, the quality is good.”</p>
<p>“Meii. Luckily it’s empty right now..” Rain sighed as she saw nobody
in sight, although she did hear some voices which worried her.</p>
<p>“You should get ready too. I could help you!”</p>
<p>“NO. No, thanks Meii. I’ll spectate.”</p>
<p>“Kay, you better…”</p>
<p>After 10 minutes, a loud voice was heard that made them jump.</p>
<p>*HURRY UP NIGGERS.*</p>
<p>“WHAT.” Rain said in shock. “I don’t think that’s said in the
show..”</p>
<p>“It’s not..” Meii confirmed as he squinted his eyes and his corner
mouth stretched, suspicious of where they are.</p>
<p>“This is so lame, I’m not ready.”</p>
<p>After 5 minutes, Meii was ready so he got up.</p>
<p>“How I look?”</p>
<p>“Really good!!!! Wtf. Gorgeous.”</p>
<p>“Only really good and gorgeous?” Meii, disappointed, slumped his
shoulders.</p>
<p>“I should’ve taken ozempic before this omfghshshsh”</p>
<p>“Meii. You look GOOD.”</p>
<p>“I know..”</p>
<p>“Sigh. Let’s just go already.”</p>
<p>“Yay!”</p>
<p>On their way to the runaway, Rain stayed behind so she could just
barely watch as she saw how Meii got in line behind other drag racers-
whose faces he couldn’t distinguish well.</p>
<p>“FINALLY. WE’RE STARTING THE GODDAMN SHOW!!!!!!”</p>
<p>“Alright, come in babes.” Said a distant voice, just as powerful as
the previous one. So then they all strutted in, including Meii. As they
all got in front, Meii could finally see who they were and he was
SHOOKETH. Not only were they faces of people he knew, but so were the
judges.</p>
<p>“I, am Leithal Maximus.” Said a drag racer who had mid makeup, but
awesome hair. He then did a 360 noscope.</p>
<p>“Ew. I think I just got the ick.” Said Mer in the audience, followed
by Leithal Maximus who just said “Word”.</p>
<p>“You SHOULD know this by now, I’m THE Carmen Redd.” She then throws a
taco at one of the judges.</p>
<p>“Nigger. DON’T DO THAT.” Scolded somebody in the audience.</p>
<p>“Hey pretties. I’m BBG, a.k.a Beautiful Black Goddess.” Said a
beautiful black goddess, as she shyly did the snoop dogg dance.</p>
<p>“That was SO good!!” Shouted a duck with salmonella from the
audience.</p>
<p>“Starbeeyatch in this bitch AWOOP.” Said a latino as he then cried
right on the spot, he was definitely forced to be here.</p>
<p>“HOTnite.” Said a vaper as he then waited for cheers. Which he only
got one from the audience, which was a white girl who was going
crazy.</p>
<p>“YESSSS YOU’RE SO SEXY BABES YOU’RE GONNA WINNN!!!!”</p>
<p>“Immortal awesome fashion dictator.” Simply said they, as they tried
to shoot HOTnite and purposely failed. There was loud clapping coming
from the audience and from Rain.</p>
<p>“I AM. Endangered Mongolian.” Said a man of color with down syndrome
as he then did the splits and swinged his luscious blonde hair that
resembled Cinderella’s. (This is supposed to be Kyle btw for those who
don’t know)<img src="./qrte3m3b.png"
style="width:6.93433in;height:3.73387in" /></p>
<p>“I am the elegant Queen Shaqi.” Womb then proceeded to look
gorjus.</p>
<p>“I’m Meii A.K.A. Da slayer, and I’m DAT bitch.” He just posed like
somebody on a magazine. Rain cheered loudly and Meii, confidently,
glanced to look at the judges’ reactions, which seemed positive.</p>
<p>“Kuwaiti oil. Hi big bros!!!” Said a barrel as it then spout oil
specifically at the second judge.</p>
<p>“Kitty kat kat!” She then posed very cutely, instant win.</p>
<p>“It goes, it goes, tio gilipollas! Bleeaghh!” Growled an emo looking
guy who then pretended to play guitar cus he’s a weirdo.</p>
<p>“Ur so gonna win :3” Cheered a puppy in the crowd. It was then Meii’s
turn. Wait, wasn’t that earlier?</p>
<p>“I’m the one and only Meii A.K.A Da slayer, and I’m DAT bitch.” He
just posed like somebody on a magazine. Everyone’s eyes widened,
including Meii’s. Nervously, he glanced to look at the judges and his
left, seeing..himself? He looked back at the judges and noticed the
first one looked like Denii, the second like Joseph, third was
definitely Mimi and fourth was Angelo.</p>
<p>Most took the 2 Meii’s casually, they’ve seen worse (stars face
leel).</p>
<p><img src="./tds3tgmc.png"
style="width:6.93433in;height:5.84529in" /></p>
<p>“Umm.. the results are in…” Denii revealed as she looked at her
papers. She then shot her eyes up at somebody in particular.</p>
<p>“Queen Shaqi… go get your bags ready.” Queen Shaqi then almost pissed
herself.</p>
<p>“.. because you’re staying!!!”</p>
<p>“OMG..!!! Thank you, thank you!!” She exclaimed as she covered her
mouth and walked away proudly.</p>
<p>“Hotnite, Kitty kat kat, Endangered Mongolian, Kuwaiti Oil, Beautiful
Black Goddess, Starebeeytatch and Alien fucker.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“YOU’RE SAFE TOO!!!!” They sighed in relief and walked away.</p>
<p>“Meii Da Slayers.” Simply stated Mimi as she looked at them directly.
“Y’all’s makeup are FLAWLESS. Definitely staying.”</p>
<p>“Oh thanks queen, I know.” Both Meiis synchronically said and walked
away as they stood where the other winners were.</p>
<p>“So, it’s only you ladies now. Leithal Maximus, Carmen Redd and
Immortal Awesome Fashion Dictator.” Denii
affirmed.<img src="./hazp3vp3.png"
style="width:3.35604in;height:4.03392in" /></p>
<p>“Did we LOSE.” Carmen Redd asked with a bothered look.</p>
<p>“It’s not because of the fact that I may not like you, because if
that WAS the reasoning, Leithal Maximus would’ve been safe and HOTnite
would’ve lost-“ Forty was then interrupted.</p>
<p>“Brah. It’s over. Fuck you.” Leithal Maximus cursed as he did the
middle finger and this sick backflip:</p>
<p>“Leithbros..”</p>
<p>“I lose u die” Immortal Awesome Fashion Dictator then pulled out
their machine gun and started shooting everyone, killing most including
the past Meii.</p>
<p>“Nah, the crakkas are crazy!!” Meii scrumpt as he then ran back to
the werk room, dragging Rain along him too obviously.</p>
<p>“WHY IS SAUR DOING THAT!!” Rain screamed as she ran with him.</p>
<p>“Girl, are you really asking that.” Meii uttered as he then got into
the time machine with Rain and clicked loads of buttons.
SCREEEEoiuuuuuuiiighhYEEAAHHHHUUUUUekkkkkkk BANG. BANG.</p>
<p>“ARE WE GETTING SHOT!?????” Rain asked as she covered her ears again,
so why is she asking if she can’t hear omfg i ahtebthis.</p>
<p>“SHOT NO BACKSHOTS YES” Mei screamed, then taking a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Lemme look outside..” Meii offered and stepped outside before Rain
could be against it.</p>
<p>“Omg. Ew..” He simply said.</p>
<p>“Ew?!??? Uhhh, where are we?!???” Rain whispered, as she was still
eerie.</p>
<p>“In a cleaning… closet?? There’s lots of cleaning supplies..”</p>
<p>“How is THAT ew??”</p>
<p>“It just is. Look! There’s a door………” Meii said with a feigned
surprised look as he held out his hand to open it.</p>
<p>“Don’t open it!! Let’s just get out of here pleassseee!!”</p>
<p>“Oh sorry, it already opened.”</p>
<p>“MEII.”</p>
<p>“Might as well see where we are..” Meii suggested as he suspiciously
stepped out, while Rain reluctantly followed.</p>
<p>Lockers, a squeaky shiny floor, posters, long hallway, rules… It was
obvious to the both of them that they were in a school.</p>
<p>“A school??” The both of them questioned.</p>
<p>DUURRR.. DING DING, a bell rang. The hallways quickly became flooded
and Rain lost sight of Meii.</p>
<p>“Racism class was so easy ong brah.” Said Leith, a 6’5 New Zealander
with a mullet, as he opened his locker.</p>
<p>“Vape tiem!!” Joked Alfie.<img src="./hhkdec5a.png"
style="width:2.93376in;height:2.20032in" /><img src="./qldaymfw.png"
style="width:2.94487in;height:2.21143in" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bro don’t. Cuz if you do, Principal Forty will suspend you.” Big
warned as he took a puff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“LOLOLOLOL. I think it’s only you.” Kyle said as he pushed a Costa
Rican goblin into a locker, pinning him with foam forming in his
mouth.</p>
<p>“KYLE!! You can’t do that. Leave Alonso alone.” Shaqi scolded as she
pulled him out.</p>
<p>“You’re so kind Shaqi, thank you I love you!! If only you were fat..”
Starglitch whimpered as he adjusted his giant glasses.</p>
<p>“Aww..” She then glared at Kyle before walking away.</p>
<p>“You’re getting a swirly after school.” Threatened Kyle, but the only
threatening thing was his diet consisting of eating 5 full pizzas for
breakfast. This is how he copes after his parasocial GF broke up with
him.</p>
<p>“At least I’m not a stupid washed fuck like Branden.” Starglitch
condescendingly spitted, throwing shit at Big for no reason.</p>
<p>“Bruh. At least I’m not bad at fortnite like Star..”</p>
<p>“If Josephine knew you were bothering me rn..” Star threatened,
before hearing a loud voice.</p>
<p>“QUIT BOTHERING MY KITTEN.” Said definitely-not-Joseph through the
speakers.</p>
<p>“He’s a grown man, why is he saying that?” Racer questioned as he
looked up at the speakers with an almost disturbed look.</p>
<p>“Pfft. Wasn’t he banned from schools?” Redsilver immediately answered
as she chewed gum loudly.</p>
<p>“Careful obesa, didn’t you want your biology teacher to groom you…”
Interrogated Kyle with a cocky tone of voice.</p>
<p>“What’s her name… Miss. Yoshiiikage…?” Leith added.</p>
<p>“Bruh. Just say Yoshi.” Big said.</p>
<p>“Umm—That was a joke though.. Obviously!” Redsilver panicked. Was she
afraid of being seen as a lesbian or as someone who likes older
people?.</p>
<p>“You want to repeat the Kerroid-Sean incident?” Jock Gerald asked as
he approached behind them.</p>
<p>“Hey..” Kerroid uttered, caressing Gerald’s chest. He didn’t want to
bring up the incident</p>
<p><img src="./fyun0y5g.png"
style="width:7.23438in;height:4.13393in" /></p>
<p>“Where is Meii..Ugh..” Rain whispered to herself, walking down the
hallways in search of Meii.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the cafeteria already, big bros! P.E is next.” Abood
considered, needing everybody else’s approval of such idea.</p>
<p>“Brah I hate P.E. Oreca is such a freaky teacher. Idk how he became
one.” Leaf moaned and both Redsilver, Abood and Kyle nutted.(Nat wrote
that)</p>
<p>“To be a teacher, you must first be a sex offender.” Stated Kyle.</p>
<p>“Then riddle me this, why won’t Yoshi MOLEST MEEEEE!!!???!!?” Cried
Redsilver.</p>
<p>“Ugly” Kyle answered.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear your retardedness anymore. Get. Moving.”
Bitterly scolded the history teacher, Hex.</p>
<p>“God. I hate women.” So the idiots had no choice but to walk to the
cafeteria.</p>
<p>Luckily, they didn’t spot Rain, who was hiding in plain sight. Until
Hex straightened his posture, cracking his back and neck, spotting
her.</p>
<p>“You…” His eyes widened.</p>
<p>“I thought you were expelled by daddy- I mean, the Principal.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, that was a hoax.” Rain lied, she didn’t even know what he
meant by that.</p>
<p>“..Yah.” Suspiciously said Hex.</p>
<p>“Hm. Okay then.” He walked away, cracking his knuckles.</p>
<p>“That was so close..” Rain sighed in relief, taking a look at the
hallways and spotting Meii.</p>
<p>“MEII!” Rain spat out, quickly covering her mouth in
embarrassment.</p>
<p>Meii turned around, following the voice and finding Rain.</p>
<p>“Rain?..”</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?..”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Rain, confused, narrowed her eyes, trying to figure out his
question.</p>
<p>Mei raised an eyebrow, his hand on his hip.</p>
<p>“Ohh!”</p>
<p>“Wrong one..” Rain chuckled, awkwardly walking away without answering
the question.</p>
<p>◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>Rain was at the entrance of the cafeteria, taking in how many people
there were.</p>
<p>It was loud and torturously stinky. Rain sat at one of the fuller
tables, waving at the first fetus she recognized—Kat.</p>
<p>“Hi..” Said Kat, the friendliest looking one.</p>
<p>“Is that Rain? Mashallah. IT IS. Aw. Sit next to Zam.” Shaqi advised
as she pointed towards a distant table, where only emos sat.</p>
<p>“Oh uh..” Rain got up, obeying as she walked to the table Shaqi
referred to.</p>
<p>Rain turned around and saw how Meii stayed back there, it seemed he
was offered to sit at their table, which he did. She wondered if that
was her Meii, but didn’t want to risk embarrassing herself again.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, she was at the designated table.</p>
<p>“Um.. haiiiii.” She greeted. Rain could see that besides Zam sitting
here, there was also Zoe, Saur, Vek and Alfie.</p>
<p>“Hiello” Zoe and Alfie replied, their different greetings layering
each other. Zam looked a bit sour, as so did Saur and Vek. But they
usually did, so Rain wasn’t too concerned.</p>
<p>“Why’d you come back.” Bluntly asked Zam.</p>
<p>“Wha-“ What the h*ck did she mean by that, wondered Rain. “What do
you mean..?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t she get expelled??” Asked Alfie to the others, not so
discreetly.</p>
<p>“I honestly don’t know or remember anything.”, Rain said. Before they
could interrogate her anymore, there was a loud commotion coming from
the other table.</p>
<p>“I WANT DICKKKKK!!!!!” Kyle screamed as he banged his head against
the table and his face flattened.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that.” Tried ordering Yoshi from a distance, checking in
the cafeteria.</p>
<p>“Tch..” As most were eating, a blonde white chick approached
Big.<img src="./44qzi50q.png"
style="width:6.93433in;height:5.18964in" /></p>
<p>“Hi Branden..” She uttered, eyes fixated on him.</p>
<p>“Huh.” He simply said, not even turning around.</p>
<p>“I want you.” She mumbled.</p>
<p>“What.” Still doesn’t get the clue.</p>
<p>“No flirting in school chuddy.” Sean, the Sex ed teacher warned as he
walked over to the emo table to flirt with Alfie.</p>
<p>“I don’t listen to naggots.” Pastel screamed at him, only in her head
because she was too much of a pussy.</p>
<p>She then pulled out a sign that said “Will you go to prom with me and
be my victory royale?” and fortnite merchandise.</p>
<p>“Turn around notorious..” Leith urged as he held in his laughter.</p>
<p>“Relationship goals :3!” Cheered Redsilver.</p>
<p>“Girl. No way..” Meii said, slightly disturbed.</p>
<p>“Bruh.” Big said as he slowly turned around. “Fortnite….” He sighed
under his breath as he was admiring the sign.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Just how you like it..” Reminded a hopeful Pastel.</p>
<p>Big looked up at Pastel, getting up and softly smiling at her.
Afterwards, he took the sign and threw it on the ground, stomping on it
a million times.</p>
<p>“YOU DIDN’T EVEN FINISH DOING MY HOMEWORK, YOU CUNT!!!!” He shout at
her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry..” Pastel apologized, before clutching her fists.</p>
<p>“LAZY ASS!!” She said, screaming as she threw him a tomato.</p>
<p>“Oh, It’s on.” Big got meatloaf and threw it at her head.</p>
<p>“FOOD FIGHT!!!” Star’s corny ass said, as he was then thrown a fork,
which stabbed his eye.</p>
<p>At this point, everybody in the cafeteria was aimlessly throwing
food. Meii and Rain looked at each other and with a single look, agreed
on fleeing.</p>
<p>◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>Running away together, they went to where they initially came from,
the janitor’s closet.</p>
<p>Once they arrived, they noticed somebody else was in there, hiding in
the shadows.</p>
<p>“So… you two aren’t exactly from here, right?”</p>
<p>It was Principal Forty, who was monitoring them since they first came
here.</p>
<p>“How-“ Rain tilted her head, almost scared.</p>
<p>“Omfg. Can you not???” Meii groaned with a facepalm.</p>
<p>“Whatwhatwhatehstehstgswtaht-“</p>
<p>“Strange, isn’t it?” Said Principal Forty, stepping closer.</p>
<p>He poked Rain, looking her dead in the eyes.</p>
<p>“I expelled you.” He turned to Meii, speaking up again. “There are 2
of you.”</p>
<p>“Expelled?!???????!!!!???!” Repeated Rain with a weirded out
look.</p>
<p>“So you don’t remember? Good.”</p>
<p>Rain gritted her teeth, grabbing a knife from her purse.</p>
<p>“I’m not afraid to use it!” Rain said, clearly afraid to use it.</p>
<p>Principal Forty maniacally laughed, putting his hands on their
shoulders. He stopped laughing, keeping them close.</p>
<p>“You can’t..”</p>
<p>“Me being here—YOU being here, means that you didn’t kill me.”</p>
<p>He backed up, letting go of them and looking at Meii.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember what happened next?”</p>
<p>Meii stepped back, starting to remember everything. He looked like he
was losing his marbles so Rain spoke up.</p>
<p>“What’s happening?? Are you okay??”</p>
<p>Due to Rain’s womanhood, she had bad memory and so couldn’t remember
anything.</p>
<p>I guess you could say it was reMEIImbering..heh</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Meii grabbed Rain’s hand and went into the time
machine.</p>
<p>“Go back to where you came from, goys.” Principal Forty demanded as
he kicked the machine and walked away.</p>
<p>Before Rain could ask any more questions, Meii was clicking random
buttons again. WEEEEEEGGHghhhuuuurshhhhhhSHHuuuuuIIIAAAAEEEEHHH BaDUNK.
Bang.</p>
<p>They were both silent, Meii being deep in thought. Both of them
stepped out, and it was the exact location Principal Forty wished for
them to go.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you..?” Rain broke the silence, standing still as
they found themselves back in her room. She smacked him, again after the
first time.</p>
<p>Meii snapped out of it, now looking at Rain without shaking.</p>
<p>“Idk.” Meii said as he disassembled the machine and put it back into
his purse. He clearly didn’t plan on saying anything else, so they
headed out of the dorm.</p>
<p>Walking in the hallway, they could tell it was pretty quiet. Maybe
they were in their respective rooms. If it were opposite day, they’d be
in the gym.</p>
<p>Once they stepped into the lobby, they were jumpscared by Forty.</p>
<p>“Hey there.” He ominously uttered.</p>
<p>“EEK!!” Rain shrieked.</p>
<p>“GYAKKK- don’t do that.” Meii shout.</p>
<p>“Then don’t try escaping!!” Warned Forty.</p>
<p>“We didn’t..” Meii lied through his teeth.</p>
<p>Forty turned to Rain, staring at her soul.</p>
<p>“Go to your room. This is adult talk.”</p>
<p>◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>They had sex. That’s what I thought happened, because I’m a porn
addict and I must get my source from somewhere- so, I’ll soil my mind
for weeds that poison.</p>
<p>I mean, what else am I supposed to assume? Meii and Rain haven’t
returned. I’m in the gym, with the other guys as well, who definitely
invited me out of guilt.</p>
<p>It was past 5 pm. So we already ate dinner and everything. Usually,
back in Costa Rica, I’d get whiffs of random foods. Bacon, eggs, bread,
burnt meat, blood and cheese. It’s not because</p>
<p>they’d be near me, but because I was dying of famine and I would
start hallucinating the smells.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I just got the whiff of… muffins. Disappointing,
it’s supposed to smell like sweat.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was just MY imagination, so I asked others.</p>
<p>“Guys.. do you smell muffins?” I asked, to anybody willing to
listen.</p>
<p>Gerald stopped dribbling and raised his head, sniffing the air.</p>
<p>“Strange.” He smelt it too.</p>
<p>“It’s my ass, eat it.” Kyle urged.</p>
<p>“Let’s go downstairs and find out bro.” Abood suggested. I was going
to, but I’m glad he did since if I did, I would’ve been shut down.</p>
<p>◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>Once we all arrived to the lobby, Forty was already there.</p>
<p>“Right when I was about to call you moids.” He uttered, with a
sinister look.</p>
<p>“Why does it smell like this? I think the answer is pretty obvious..”
Forty replied.</p>
<p>“Get in the dining hall, DAMNIT!!!” So we all obeyed. I was faster
than the rest though, since I was excited to try muffins for the first
time. To us Costa Ricans, it was considered a delicacy.</p>
<p>I was the first to enter, crossing my fingers that he’ll give me a
prize for it. Actually. The rest of the acapcels were in the dining hall
already.</p>
<p>“Now that you’re all collectively here.. I got a little treat for
you.” Forty had an apron on.</p>
<p>Is this a way of saying he’s ready to be a mother? I’ll accept him
with loving arms. He’d be such a good boywife.</p>
<p>What I didn’t notice was that he was holding a tray of muffins,
enough to feed us all.</p>
<p><img src="./y2nyccnw.png"
style="width:3.33381in;height:4.9785in" /></p>
<p>“Eat, my children.” He instructed as he set the tray down.</p>
<p>“Eat your children?” Someone in the background asked.</p>
<p>“NO! Only I eat children! Just eat.” Forty responded.</p>
<p><img src="./ji3rz21s.png"
style="width:6.93433in;height:4.62289in" /></p>
<p>“Aw..” Shaqi muttered as she got one.</p>
<p>“Wait, why are they stinky?”</p>
<p>“And where’s Meii.” Rain angrily questioned.</p>
<p>“They’re not stinky, big bro Joseph!” Lied Abood, as he got one and
ate it whole. His barrel momentarily turned green in disgust.
“Awesome..”</p>
<p>As his husband, I should’ve been the first one to eat it. I got one
and took a bite. Oh my god, this is so foul.</p>
<p>Trying to hold in a piss for a whole day is easier than trying to
hold in whatever I just ate.</p>
<p>“Is that a pube in the muffin.” Kyle asked with enticement.</p>
<p>“Babies. Can’t be THAT shitty..” Redsilver mocked as she got one and
took a bite without hesitation.</p>
<p>“EACKKK!!! WHAT IS THIS?!???” She spat it out immediately.</p>
<p>“Retard.” Yoshi scolded.</p>
<p>“This is why you called us? I’m out.” Hex stated, until he was
stopped by Forty, who got right in front of him.</p>
<p>“EVERYBODY here has to eat it to leave.” Forty conditioned his hair,
then left. He’ll definitely look at us suffering through the
cameras.</p>
<p>My vision got blurry and fuzzy, I CAN’T SEE SHIT HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
EAT THIS!! My body then grew numb, I could only feel how my body
suddenly hit the ground.<img src="./jjcfvarh.png"

<p>◌ ✩‧₊˚༺☆༻◌ ✩‧₊˚</p>
<p>Roblox condos… toya.. ps3….. chatas dying… crossdressing.. Best dream
ever!!</p>
<p>I woke up, and didn’t feel like dying despite what I ate. My brain
probably gave me one of the best dreams I could ever think of, as a
survival instinct so I won’t kill myself because of what I just ate.</p>
<p>I was in my room. Somebody must’ve taken me here. Oh! I hope they
took my virginity! I touch my anus to feel if it was used.</p>
<p>It wasn’t. Now I want to die again.</p>
<p>There weren’t any murders this time, but at what cost? I’m too young
to vote, but not to die.</p>
<p>I’m too young to love, too old to cry. Too young for chest hair, too
old for Joseph.</p>
<p>I’ll find my victim tomorrow.</p>
<p>El fi-</p>
<p>Star’s door was slammed open, Kyle walking in as he took his suit
off. “Hey girl.” He said, trying to seem manly but in reality sounding
cringe.</p>
<p>“Que??!” Star shouted, wiping his eyes.</p>
<p>“We’re escaping this bitch.”</p>
<p>“For Meii.”</p>
<p>Star: “For Meii?..”</p>
<p>Kyle walked to a wall, trying to break it by punching it. The only
thing he broke were his knuckles</p>
<p>He squealed, making Star burst into laughter even though he doesn’t
have room to laugh.</p>
<p>“I get hurt, trying to help, AND YOU LAUGH?’’!!!!1!????????” Kyle
bitterly scrumpt at me, which silenced me.</p>
<p>“Yeah, like you don’t make fun of me too………”</p>
<p>I reminded. I like kyle, but he makes me feel insecure and I don’t
like that. If I did, I would act like a dog for Joseph despite him not
interested.</p>
<p>“It’s all shits and giggles, tonto.” Kyle was… communicating with me
in spanish??? That has never happened..</p>
<p>“Whatever you say, Kyle..”</p>
<p>I replied with a chuckle.</p>
<p>This was strange.. I haven’t felt both my vibes or dick this elevated
before!</p>
<p>I’m forgiving him because I know he’ll be of good service.</p>
<p>Interrupting the romantic scenery, I could see how yellow fluid was
spilling out of Kyle’s muscle.</p>
<p>“Umm.. what’s *that*?”</p>
<p>“My.. uh..”</p>
<p>Kyle darted at his injury and covered it with his other hand.</p>
<p>“My testosterone.”</p>
<p>“Oh..”</p>
<p>He wasn’t *trans*, was he..? Before I could even get to ask my
question he hurriedly turned around and scampered out the room.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you later starbitch.”</p>
<p>There was a small poodle of his yellow fluid on the floor. I inched
towards it and deeply smelled it, almost inhaling it.</p>
<p>Ew..! It smelled rancid. Como.. like a urinal. No way. This can’t
be…</p>
<p>piss?</p>
<p>My eyes shot back, and I looked at the ceiling.</p>
<p>“THANK YOU, GOD!! THANK YOUU!! I’ll appreciate your gifts!”</p>
<p>I screamed as I looked back down at the puddle, kissing the
crucifix.</p>
<p>It was a sign. A sign of a friendship. I knew I wouldn’t die alone.
That wasn’t what the game had planned out for me. Time has it out for
me, so I won’t hide. I’ll stay here in the open field, waiting</p>
<p>for what’s looking to find me. Whether it be death or Kyle, it’s
already happening.</p>
<p>El fi-</p>
<p>RING RIRING RIN G RING</p>
<p>Everyone started packing up to leave class, except Alfie because he
was staying after class.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah!”</p>
<p>Asserted Sean as he wiggled his finger as an opposition to their
fleeing. “The bell doesn’t dismiss you, I DO.”</p>
<p>Big’s skin turned red in anger, his armpit hair growing rapidly.</p>
<p>Redsilver: “Twinsies!!”</p>
<p>“HOW LONG UNTIL WE LEAVE THIS FRIGGIN CLASS???? NOONE CARES ABOUT SEX
ED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Big (s)creamed, throwing books at the
teacher.</p>
<p>Alfie jumped in the way to take the hits for Sean. “NOOO!!”</p>
<p>*thump*</p>
<p>Big, about to jump Sean, was restrained by Kyle.</p>
<p>“He’s not worth it..” Moaned Kyle, who couldn’t hold him for too long
as his muscles and veins teared like wires on utility poles and his
“testosterone” spewed out of them.</p>
<p>“STOPPP” Big and Kyle synchronically shouted at eachother, sumo
wrestling.</p>
<p>“Awww! They’re practically cuddling!” Shaqi said, admiring the
two.</p>
<p>“FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT” Nat repeatedly said, thinking others will
join in. Noone did.</p>
<p>Big’s hair piloerected, thinking Kyle had pissed on him. “THE
HECK.”</p>
<p>Kyle jumped up, trying to cover the wounds on his arms that squirted
urine. “It’s not what it looks like!!”</p>
<p>“YOU PISSED ON ME1!!1!” Shouted Big, who was about to rape Kyle.</p>
<p>“Settle down class!!” Said Sean, who then glanced at his watch and
sighed. “Just..Get OUT.”</p>
<p>Meii snapped out of his thoughts, raising his head. “Oh.. Right!”</p>
<p>“Byyyeee! See you later. Oh, definitely.”</p>
<p>Meii was reassuring to Shaqi and Kat, as he walked the other way.</p>
<p>“Definitely- NOT. I GOT to get out of here.”</p>
<p>Meii walked down the hallways, which got emptier and emptier.</p>
<p>He contemplated on calling out Rain’s name, but he figured it could
possibly get him in trouble.He resorted to using the time machine, so he
hurriedly walked towards the janitors closet and saw how it was no
longer there.</p>
<p>“WHAT?? RAIN???!???” He screamed internally.</p>
<p>Meii took a full on day looking at where the time machine was
supposed to be.</p>
<p>He’d scream her name once more, but he’d know it was futile.</p>
<p>Thinking of what to do, Meii looked through the classroom windows-
often spotting illegal activities and hearing kissing, until he saw a
classroom with one measly backpack inside.</p>
<p>Finding it strange, since it seemed Meii was the only student left,
he grabbed a notebook inside it and peaked.</p>
