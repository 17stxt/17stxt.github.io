Omaha, Nebraska.
A sunny day above Acap Headquarters.

“Zzzzzz”

The loud snores of Joseph, otherwise known as “Josephine” or “Forty”, stormed the entire city

(Children in the background)
“Hehehehe!”
“Give that back, or i’m telling Forty!”
“I dare you!”

Forty: “Zzzzzz…must…rape..”

His phone vibrates from a Tinder notification, immediately waking him up because it was inbetween his ass cheeks.

He vigorously removes it and throws it on the table for no reason at all.

Forty: “Bure nyuu~”

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bafa9492-85fa-4095-b1b4-add3f1a8b04b)

Forty: “Expired.” (swipes left)

He wants to take another nap but he suddenly thinks of Acap.

Forty: “Well, it has been a while.” (this nigga talks to himself)

Using surveillance cameras, he watches over Acap Park.

Forty: “Good grief..”

He continues to watch his children, examining them as if he’s a death note character (he thinks that’s cool)

He puts the phone down and sighs.

“These normies are so happy, and for what?”

He decides to call in the bois for a discussion.

(Brad is also there but he’s too short for the camera)

Forty: “I know this is out of the blue, but…”
He sighs.

Forty: “I want to put an end to Acap, and for real this time.”

Brad: “Is that a band?”

Angelo: “It’s been 4 years.”

Forty: “Which is exactly why we should do this.”

Angelo took another puff of his vape. (he ordered it from temu because he couldn’t afford an actual one)

Mimi: “Why can’t we just forget them? They don’t matter anymore.”

Forty: “You’re a woman, of course you don’t understand.”

He jested with his left hand rubbing his temples, frustrated. This feeling worsened once he saw how he abruptly got
notifications from his phone.

Hey forty we wov u n we want back shots :3

He reached out his hand to grab his phone, when suddenly he threw it hard against the wall.

Forty: “..grrrAUUUUGH!”

Leith: “Nigga chill.”

All the owomachads were silent, concerned on the way Forty reacted.

Forty: “Just get out.”

They didn’t listen the first time, so Forty had to release his alpha.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/082b151e-1a9a-434c-a096-0da61980f233)

Forty: “GET OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

This time, they left; except for Rya who was standing beside Forty.

Rya: “I like your plan..rawr..heh..”

Forty: “And I like you, honey pie.”

They made out.

Starglitch’s Pov

The first thing Starglitch noticed, besides his microdick hardening, was that he awoke in a clean place he has never
slept before. This room, was BY faaar cleaner than his third world room.

Starglitch: “Where am I..”

His eyes were barely opened and his 3 hair strands were tangled. He stood up from the bed and looked around more.
By the bed, there was a nightstand with 2 drawers. He opened the first drawers and saw 2 measly pairs of thongs.
His thongs. 

He opened the second drawer which had pairs of the clothing he had on at the moment.

Starglitch: “How is my stuff here?!? And how is it so clean??”

He asked out loud, with a mixture of paranoia and irritation. 

Looking for answers, he stepped out of his room and found himself in a hallway where beside his room’s door there were several other doors which above them had
names.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d299bd44-5fcf-4966-b473-7f142e69ca16)

Normally, one would read the names, but Starglitch is a retard. So instead, he walked towards the end of the hallway
which had a door, different from the rest as it had no name and was bigger. Behind the door was a massive room, it
seemed it would be the hotspot in a house, possibly the living room. 

There were 15 people in the middle of the room, confused and distanced from each other like strangers.

Starglitch walked nervously towards them and looked up to see who they are, which he didn’t recognize whatsoever.
As opposed to Starglitch, the 15 people did recognize him.

Redsilver: “…wait a second....”

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95241f21-8d0e-4d67-9f5c-18b90fa17359)

Redsilver: “BAHAHAHAHAAHA!!!”

One of the girls started to laugh at him, grabbing her stomach and almost falling over.

Abdullah Ahmed (Abood): “Alonso?”

Others begin to laugh too, though not as hard as the obnoxious one.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0425f44-9f4a-4fde-aaeb-21ad07a01643)

(They beat abood for talking and dom for existing which is why they’re not there)

Starglitch: “Yeah, yeah, I’m Starglitch.”

Shaqi: “Wait, so that means..”

Starglitch: “Are you all from ACAP too?”

(Momentary silence)

Rain: “What??!”

Redsilver: “Are we seriously here because of some stupid bigoted Discord server?!?”

Gerald: “I thought that much was obvious..”

Sheri: “What- how?..” She began to hyperventilate.

Gerald: “Did you not read the nameplates..??”

Starglitch: “Well, I’m fucked.”

Dom: “Woaah that is sooo cool” (he doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation)

Hex: “I fucking hate you retards, this is why I left. The retardedness is a disease, all of you get the fuck away from
me.”

Shaqi: “No, YOU get away from me! Fatty!!”

Hex: “Fatty?!?”

Zam: “Shut. Up.

Kyle: “All this arguing got me hard-“

“SHUT THE FUCK UP. NIGGERS.”

Everybody, silenced, turned around to see the source of the voice.

They see a muscular body menacingly walk out of the shadows.

Redsilver: “Are you.. are you who got us here?”

Rya: “Oh me? :3 kinda.. wait for master to appear ! It’ll be any minute >_< “

Saur: “You kidnap us and then you also make us wait?!?”

Rya: “Ah, don’t get ur panties in a twist >:3 i said any minute now !!”

“hai :3”

It was Forty, that jew!
He appeared behind the muscular body builder and looked down at the 15 idiots with contempt.

Shaqi: “I recognize that face too.. Ugh, damn my womanhood! I can’t remember who he is!”

Gerald: “Is that not.. Joseph..?”

Shaqi: “Oh.”

Starglitch: “Joshephine!!”

Kyle: “Does this mean we are finally getting the backshots :0 ?”

Forty: “You’re too old for me. Anyway.. this is Rya, my angelic wife.” He proclaimed as he grabbed Rya’s muscular
ass, his cheery voice then deepening.

Forty: “I fucking hate autistics and you’re all autistic as heck. Especially you, Rain.”

Rain: “HUH?! What does-“

Forty: “QUIET. As I was saying, I regret making Acap. It was supposed to be a safezone for autists but over the
years, it’s turned into a hellhole. Look, I can no longer masturbate to you guys.”

Starglitch’s smile turned upside down.

Zam: “I left a whole ass time ago and forgot about this shit, why the fuck am I being dragged here?!”
Hex nodded.

Kat: “Me too!”

Yoshi: “What the fuck is acap?”

“It’s always the women complaining, be quiet oh my goooooood!” Forty moaned, irritated each time more, he
should probably get into anger management. “Because I hate you guys. There.”

Zam: “I regret ever joining.”

Hex tapped Zam’s shoulder in agreement, he was probably in love.

Forty “Oh, is that so.. Well.” He had a sly grin, as what he is planning will now be brought up. “All you niggers
have to do to get out is.. murder somebody else.” (his phrasing was misleading)

The room temperature suddenly lost the life it had, dropping 29 degrees.
Everybody didn’t take it seriously as it was, but they were still perplexed.
It was ACAP, who would.

One of the hostages (Saur) did, taking out their sniper and shooting Rya.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7e29b9d-94dd-4111-9dee-668b6ab6d959)

Before being shot, Rya stared at the soul of the shooter and whispered: “So long.”

Pew

Rya: “Oof owiee D:”

Forty: “NO!”

Forty howled as he ran up to her and pretended to check her pulse because he didn’t know how.
He kneeled beside Rya, looking up with grieving eyes. 

“RYAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b42544b4-5181-4762-a330-9e111e59e346)

Everyone got goosebumps (except Starglitch because he wanted to take her place)

Forty looked down and wiped his tears, standing up. “She’s dead.”

Saur: “I killed somebody, I can leave now.”

Forty: “Wrong. That was an admin.” He had a cold glare. 

“Where did you acquire that gun.. You know what? I don’t care anymore. Give it.”

Saur: “No.”

Forty: “Give it to me or no balls.”

So the shooter gave up the gun to Forty.

Forty: “Here are the rules. You must murder somebody without being caught. If you’re caught in the act, you’ll be
punished. If the rest of you don’t catch or correctly guess who the murder, you will all be punished. You can murder
up to 3 people only since I want this game to last a decent amount of time. Have fun.” 

He then walked away into a different room, his own room, Starglitch assumed. Which left the 15 idiots to think about what just happened.
Starglitch broke the silence. 

“… we should introduce ourselves.”

Rain: “What for?”

Starglitch: “To know who we are??”

“Good idea.” Said a man, he looked quite active and attractive to Starglitch. “I’m Gerald.”

“Hurry up, christ’s sake. I’m Shaqi.” Said a south asian looking girl, she looked annoying and annoyed so Starglitch
didn’t want to interact with her.

“I’m Zam.” Simply uttered a dark fashioned girl, whose expression is hard to read.

“Sheri.” Directly stated a woman, her smile was a bit bittersweet, as if trying to stay positive while awkwardly
pulling it off.

“I’m Kaaaat! Although I have a quick question-“

“Ask them after introductions.” Interrupted a more mature woman, who actually seemed bothered by her instead of
her question. “Yoshi.”

“Hehehe..” Uncomfortably giggled to herself a woman who walked up, subtly, beside Yoshi. “I’m Redsilver, or Nat.
Which ever is fine.”

“Weirdooooo.” Uttered a shorter girl with colored hair who glared at Redsilver with distaste. “I’m Rain.”

“Hex” An interesting looking man stated.

“Saur. Be grateful I killed Rya.”

Starglitch: “I am..”

“I wish instead of murder it was sex but oh well, I’m Kyle.” A femboy looking guy in disguise bantered.

“I’m Abood! Hope we become friends.” Said a friendly, slightly overweighted boy.

“Oh, I’m Sal.” Said the white female, with a sense of indifference.

“Ink.” Said a bottle of ink, confusing everyone.

(Momentary silence)

“OKAY. So, my question was.. are we going to sleep here??” Kat almost desperately questioned, it seemed as if she
was still in denial.

“No, Forty will let us go home to sleep and then when we wake up we will have to come back here.” Yoshi
sarcastically replied, clearly insulting Kat’s intelligence.

“That sounds unlikely..” Rain commented.

“Because it’s sarcasm!! RETARD!” Redsilver unnecessarily responded for Yoshi, already creating a horrible
atmosphere.

“Shut up nigger-“ Shaqi snarled.

“I really wish I still had the gun right now.” Saur seethed with bottled annoyance.

“Why don’t we just go to each other’s room, since you all seem riled up-“ Starglitch suggested which was then shut
off by a loud disagreement.

”NO.” Straight after, the rest of the members started to argue, drowning out each other.

Starglitch just stayed there idly, watching the commotion.

“GUYS! What if we go to our separate rooms?” Gerald loudly and originally persuaded.

“Not a bad idea.” Sal mentioned with a shrug.

Leaving Starglitch dumbfounded, the rest walked away to go to their own dorms. Now in his destined room,

Starglitch laid down on his bed rethinking what just happened.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaf13192-0c67-4834-92c6-296b950a0f97)

He desired to have the willpower to murder, not only to get out, but to also kill Redsilver since she’s loud,
problematic and annoying as heck. But Starglitch was somewhat relieved to know he can’t and won’t.
He understood that if he was caught he’d be punished right away, and it wouldn’t be pretty. But there would only be
one way to find out.
