<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="18">Omaha, Nebraska.<br>
A sunny day above Acap Headquarters.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">“Zzzzzz”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">The loud snores of Joseph, otherwise known as “Josephine” or “Forty”, stormed the entire city</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="27">(Children in the background)<br>
“Hehehehe!”<br>
“Give that back, or i’m telling Forty!”<br>
“I dare you!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="28" data-line-end="29"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd0eef01-dc32-4f7c-891f-4af23d0e9841" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="30" data-line-end="31">Forty: “Zzzzzz…must…rape…”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">His phone vibrates from a Tinder notification, immediately waking him up because it was inbetween his ass cheeks.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="34" data-line-end="35">He vigorously removes it and throws it on the table for no reason at all.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="36" data-line-end="37"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aac501b7-a2e7-416c-9b53-4a720cbeaecc" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="39">Forty: “Bure nyuu~”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="40" data-line-end="41"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bafa9492-85fa-4095-b1b4-add3f1a8b04b" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="42" data-line-end="43">Forty: “Expired.” (swipes left)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45">He wants to take another nap but he suddenly thinks of Acap.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="46" data-line-end="47">Forty: “Well, it has been a while.” (this nigga talks to himself)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="48" data-line-end="49">Using surveillance cameras, he watches over Acap Park.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="51">Forty: “Good grief…”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="52" data-line-end="53">He continues to watch his children, examining them as if he’s a death note character (he thinks that’s cool)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="54" data-line-end="55">He puts the phone down and sighs.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="56" data-line-end="57">“These normies are so happy, and for what?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="58" data-line-end="59">He decides to call in the bois for a discussion.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="60" data-line-end="61"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26c8db19-03af-44b7-9e13-528c097b9cd8" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="62" data-line-end="63">(Brad is also there but he’s too short for the camera)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="64" data-line-end="66">Forty: “I know this is out of the blue, but…”<br>
He sighs.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="67" data-line-end="68">Forty: “I want to put an end to Acap, and for real this time.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="69" data-line-end="70">Brad: “Is that a band?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="71" data-line-end="72">Angelo: “It’s been 4 years.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="73" data-line-end="74">Forty: “Which is exactly why we should do this.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="75" data-line-end="76">Angelo took another puff of his vape. (he ordered it from temu because he couldn’t afford an actual one)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="77" data-line-end="78">Mimi: “Why can’t we just forget them? They don’t matter anymore.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="79" data-line-end="80">Forty: “You’re a woman, of course you don’t understand.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="81" data-line-end="83">He jested with his left hand rubbing his temples, frustrated. This feeling worsened once he saw how he abruptly got<br>
notifications from his phone.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="84" data-line-end="85">Hey forty we wov u n we want back shots :3</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="86" data-line-end="87">He reached out his hand to grab his phone, when suddenly he threw it hard against the wall.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="88" data-line-end="89">Forty: “…grrrAUUUUGH!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="90" data-line-end="91">Leith: “Nigga chill.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="92" data-line-end="93">All the owomachads were silent, concerned on the way Forty reacted.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="94" data-line-end="95">Forty: “Just get out.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="96" data-line-end="97">They didn’t listen the first time, so Forty had to release his alpha.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="98" data-line-end="99"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/082b151e-1a9a-434c-a096-0da61980f233" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="100" data-line-end="101">Forty: “GET OUT!!!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="102" data-line-end="103">This time, they left; except for Rya who was standing beside Forty.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="104" data-line-end="105">Rya: “I like your plan…rawr…heh…”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="106" data-line-end="107">Forty: “And I like you, honey pie.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="108" data-line-end="109">They made out.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="110" data-line-end="111"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1864c50f-df96-46ef-8a0c-2c1b11cc936c" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="112" data-line-end="113">Starglitch’s Pov</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="114" data-line-end="116">The first thing Starglitch noticed, besides his microdick hardening, was that he awoke in a clean place he has never<br>
slept before. This room, was BY faaar cleaner than his third world room.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="117" data-line-end="118">Starglitch: “Where am I…”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="119" data-line-end="122">His eyes were barely opened and his 3 hair strands were tangled. He stood up from the bed and looked around more.<br>
By the bed, there was a nightstand with 2 drawers. He opened the first drawers and saw 2 measly pairs of thongs.<br>
His thongs.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="123" data-line-end="124">He opened the second drawer which had pairs of the clothing he had on at the moment.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="125" data-line-end="126">Starglitch: “How is my stuff here?!? And how is it so clean??”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="127" data-line-end="128">He asked out loud, with a mixture of paranoia and irritation.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="129" data-line-end="131">Looking for answers, he stepped out of his room and found himself in a hallway where beside his room’s door there were several other doors which above them had<br>
names.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="132" data-line-end="133"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d299bd44-5fcf-4966-b473-7f142e69ca16" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="134" data-line-end="137">Normally, one would read the names, but Starglitch is a retard. So instead, he walked towards the end of the hallway<br>
which had a door, different from the rest as it had no name and was bigger. Behind the door was a massive room, it<br>
seemed it would be the hotspot in a house, possibly the living room.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="138" data-line-end="139">There were 15 people in the middle of the room, confused and distanced from each other like strangers.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="140" data-line-end="142">Starglitch walked nervously towards them and looked up to see who they are, which he didn’t recognize whatsoever.<br>
As opposed to Starglitch, the 15 people did recognize him.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="143" data-line-end="144">Redsilver: “…wait a second…”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="145" data-line-end="146"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/211831ba-4093-4f9e-b80a-55a655d865a9" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="147" data-line-end="148"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95241f21-8d0e-4d67-9f5c-18b90fa17359" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="149" data-line-end="150">Redsilver: “BAHAHAHAHAAHA!!!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="151" data-line-end="152">One of the girls started to laugh at him, grabbing her stomach and almost falling over.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="153" data-line-end="154">Abdullah Ahmed (Abood): “Alonso?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="155" data-line-end="156">Others begin to laugh too, though not as hard as the obnoxious one.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="157" data-line-end="158"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0425f44-9f4a-4fde-aaeb-21ad07a01643" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="159" data-line-end="160">(They beat abood for talking and dom for existing which is why they’re not there)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="161" data-line-end="162">Starglitch: “Yeah, yeah, I’m Starglitch.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="163" data-line-end="164">Shaqi: “Wait, so that means…”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="165" data-line-end="166">Starglitch: “Are you all from ACAP too?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="167" data-line-end="168">(Momentary silence)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="169" data-line-end="170">Rain: “What??!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="171" data-line-end="172">Redsilver: “Are we seriously here because of some stupid bigoted Discord server?!?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="173" data-line-end="174">Gerald: “I thought that much was obvious…”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="175" data-line-end="176">Sheri: “What- how?..” She began to hyperventilate.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="177" data-line-end="178">Gerald: “Did you not read the nameplates…??”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="179" data-line-end="180">Starglitch: “Well, I’m fucked.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="181" data-line-end="182">Dom: “Woaah that is sooo cool” (he doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="183" data-line-end="185">Hex: “I fucking hate you retards, this is why I left. The retardedness is a disease, all of you get the fuck away from<br>
me.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="186" data-line-end="187">Shaqi: “No, YOU get away from me! Fatty!!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="188" data-line-end="189">Hex: “Fatty?!?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="190" data-line-end="191">Zam: “Shut. Up.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="192" data-line-end="193">Kyle: “All this arguing got me hard-“</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="194" data-line-end="195">“SHUT THE FUCK UP. NIGGERS.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="196" data-line-end="197">Everybody, silenced, turned around to see the source of the voice.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="198" data-line-end="199">They see a muscular body menacingly walk out of the shadows.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="200" data-line-end="201">Redsilver: “Are you… are you who got us here?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="202" data-line-end="203">Rya: “Oh me? :3 kinda… wait for master to appear ! It’ll be any minute &gt;_&lt; “</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="204" data-line-end="205">Saur: “You kidnap us and then you also make us wait?!?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="206" data-line-end="207">Rya: “Ah, don’t get ur panties in a twist &gt;:3 i said any minute now !!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="208" data-line-end="209">“hai :3”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="210" data-line-end="212">It was Forty, that jew!<br>
He appeared behind the muscular body builder and looked down at the 15 idiots with contempt.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="213" data-line-end="214">Shaqi: “I recognize that face too… Ugh, damn my womanhood! I can’t remember who he is!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="215" data-line-end="216">Gerald: “Is that not… Joseph…?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="217" data-line-end="218">Shaqi: “Oh.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="219" data-line-end="220">Starglitch: “Joshephine!!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="221" data-line-end="222">Kyle: “Does this mean we are finally getting the backshots :0 ?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="223" data-line-end="225">Forty: “You’re too old for me. Anyway… this is Rya, my angelic wife.” He proclaimed as he grabbed Rya’s muscular<br>
ass, his cheery voice then deepening.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="226" data-line-end="227">Forty: “I fucking hate autistics and you’re all autistic as heck. Especially you, Rain.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="228" data-line-end="229">Rain: “HUH?! What does-“</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="230" data-line-end="232">Forty: “QUIET. As I was saying, I regret making Acap. It was supposed to be a safezone for autists but over the<br>
years, it’s turned into a hellhole. Look, I can no longer masturbate to you guys.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="233" data-line-end="234">Starglitch’s smile turned upside down.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="235" data-line-end="237">Zam: “I left a whole ass time ago and forgot about this shit, why the fuck am I being dragged here?!”<br>
Hex nodded.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="238" data-line-end="239">Kat: “Me too!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="240" data-line-end="241">Yoshi: “What the fuck is acap?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="242" data-line-end="244">“It’s always the women complaining, be quiet oh my goooooood!” Forty moaned, irritated each time more, he<br>
should probably get into anger management. “Because I hate you guys. There.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="245" data-line-end="246">Zam: “I regret ever joining.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="247" data-line-end="248">Hex tapped Zam’s shoulder in agreement, he was probably in love.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="249" data-line-end="251">Forty “Oh, is that so… Well.” He had a sly grin, as what he is planning will now be brought up. “All you niggers<br>
have to do to get out is… murder somebody else.” (his phrasing was misleading)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="252" data-line-end="255">The room temperature suddenly lost the life it had, dropping 29 degrees.<br>
Everybody didn’t take it seriously as it was, but they were still perplexed.<br>
It was ACAP, who would.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="256" data-line-end="257">One of the hostages (Saur) did, taking out their sniper and shooting Rya.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="258" data-line-end="259"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7e29b9d-94dd-4111-9dee-668b6ab6d959" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="260" data-line-end="261">Before being shot, Rya stared at the soul of the shooter and whispered: “So long.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="262" data-line-end="263">Pew</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="264" data-line-end="265">Rya: “Oof owiee D:”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="266" data-line-end="267">Forty: “NO!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="268" data-line-end="270">Forty howled as he ran up to her and pretended to check her pulse because he didn’t know how.<br>
He kneeled beside Rya, looking up with grieving eyes.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="271" data-line-end="272">“RYAAA!!!”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="273" data-line-end="274"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b42544b4-5181-4762-a330-9e111e59e346" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="275" data-line-end="276">Everyone got goosebumps (except Starglitch because he wanted to take her place)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="277" data-line-end="278">Forty looked down and wiped his tears, standing up. “She’s dead.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="279" data-line-end="280">Saur: “I killed somebody, I can leave now.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="281" data-line-end="282">Forty: “Wrong. That was an admin.” He had a cold glare.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="283" data-line-end="284">“Where did you acquire that gun… You know what? I don’t care anymore. Give it.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="285" data-line-end="286">Saur: “No.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="287" data-line-end="288">Forty: “Give it to me or no balls.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="289" data-line-end="290">So the shooter gave up the gun to Forty.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="291" data-line-end="294">Forty: “Here are the rules. You must murder somebody without being caught. If you’re caught in the act, you’ll be<br>
punished. If the rest of you don’t catch or correctly guess who the murder, you will all be punished. You can murder<br>
up to 3 people only since I want this game to last a decent amount of time. Have fun.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="295" data-line-end="297">He then walked away into a different room, his own room, Starglitch assumed. Which left the 15 idiots to think about what just happened.<br>
Starglitch broke the silence.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="298" data-line-end="299">“… we should introduce ourselves.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="300" data-line-end="301">Rain: “What for?”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="302" data-line-end="303">Starglitch: “To know who we are??”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="304" data-line-end="305">“Good idea.” Said a man, he looked quite active and attractive to Starglitch. “I’m Gerald.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="306" data-line-end="308">“Hurry up, christ’s sake. I’m Shaqi.” Said a south asian looking girl, she looked annoying and annoyed so Starglitch<br>
didn’t want to interact with her.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="309" data-line-end="310">“I’m Zam.” Simply uttered a dark fashioned girl, whose expression is hard to read.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="311" data-line-end="313">“Sheri.” Directly stated a woman, her smile was a bit bittersweet, as if trying to stay positive while awkwardly<br>
pulling it off.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="314" data-line-end="315">“I’m Kaaaat! Although I have a quick question-“</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="316" data-line-end="318">“Ask them after introductions.” Interrupted a more mature woman, who actually seemed bothered by her instead of<br>
her question. “Yoshi.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="319" data-line-end="321">“Hehehe…” Uncomfortably giggled to herself a woman who walked up, subtly, beside Yoshi. “I’m Redsilver, or Nat.<br>
Which ever is fine.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="322" data-line-end="323">“Weirdooooo.” Uttered a shorter girl with colored hair who glared at Redsilver with distaste. “I’m Rain.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="324" data-line-end="325">“Hex” An interesting looking man stated.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="326" data-line-end="327">“Saur. Be grateful I killed Rya.”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="328" data-line-end="329">Starglitch: “I am…”</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="330" data-line-end="331">“I wish instead of murder it was sex but oh well, I’m Kyle.” A femboy looking guy in disguise bantered.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="332" data-line-end="333">“I’m Abood! Hope we become friends.” Said a friendly, slightly overweighted boy.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="334" data-line-end="335">“Oh, I’m Sal.” Said the white female, with a sense of indifference.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="336" data-line-end="337">“Ink.” Said a bottle of ink, confusing everyone.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="338" data-line-end="339">(Momentary silence)</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="340" data-line-end="342">“OKAY. So, my question was… are we going to sleep here??” Kat almost desperately questioned, it seemed as if she<br>
was still in denial.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="343" data-line-end="345">“No, Forty will let us go home to sleep and then when we wake up we will have to come back here.” Yoshi<br>
sarcastically replied, clearly insulting Kat’s intelligence.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="346" data-line-end="347">“That sounds unlikely…” Rain commented.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="348" data-line-end="350">“Because it’s sarcasm!! RETARD!” Redsilver unnecessarily responded for Yoshi, already creating a horrible<br>
atmosphere.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="351" data-line-end="352">“Shut up nigger-“ Shaqi snarled.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="353" data-line-end="354">“I really wish I still had the gun right now.” Saur seethed with bottled annoyance.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="355" data-line-end="357">“Why don’t we just go to each other’s room, since you all seem riled up-“ Starglitch suggested which was then shut<br>
off by a loud disagreement.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="358" data-line-end="359">”NO.” Straight after, the rest of the members started to argue, drowning out each other.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="360" data-line-end="361">Starglitch just stayed there idly, watching the commotion.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="362" data-line-end="363">“GUYS! What if we go to our separate rooms?” Gerald loudly and originally persuaded.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="364" data-line-end="365">“Not a bad idea.” Sal mentioned with a shrug.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="366" data-line-end="367">Leaving Starglitch dumbfounded, the rest walked away to go to their own dorms. Now in his destined room,</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="368" data-line-end="369">Starglitch laid down on his bed rethinking what just happened.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="370" data-line-end="371"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaf13192-0c67-4834-92c6-296b950a0f97" alt="image"></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="372" data-line-end="376">He desired to have the willpower to murder, not only to get out, but to also kill Redsilver since she’s loud,<br>
problematic and annoying as heck. But Starglitch was somewhat relieved to know he can’t and won’t.<br>
He understood that if he was caught he’d be punished right away, and it wouldn’t be pretty. But there would only be<br>
one way to find out.</p>
